            ChecklistFabrik supports importing tasks from separate YAML files.
            
            To import tasks the special `linuxfabrik.clf.import` module can be used:
            
            ```yaml
            pages:
              - title: 'Page with Imported Tasks'
                tasks:
                  - linuxfabrik.clf.import: 'import_additional_tasks.yml'
            ```
            
            There are a few important details about task imports:
            
            - Relative import paths are always relative to the importing file.
            - Imported tasks will be flattened into the saved file.
            - The file to import *must* be formatted as a list of tasks (even if it only contains one task).
            - Importing a file in an already imported file is supported.
            
            The following tasks were imported from `import_additional_tasks.yml`:

      - linuxfabrik.clf.import: 'import_additional_tasks.yml'

            Additionally, ChecklistFabrik also supports importing full pages.
            
            This works similarly to importing tasks, but on the page level:
            
            ```yaml
            pages:
              - linuxfabrik.clf.import: 'import_additional_pages.yml'
            ```
            
            There are a few important details about task imports:
            
            - Relative import paths are always relative to the importing file.
            - Imported pages will be flattened into the saved file.
            - The file to import *must* be formatted as a list of pages (even if it only contains one page).
            - Importing a file in an already imported file is supported.
            
            The next page was imported from `import_additional_pages.yml`:

  - linuxfabrik.clf.import: 'import_additional_pages.yml'
